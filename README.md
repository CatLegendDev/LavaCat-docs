## Why a written guide from MenuDocs?

MenuDocs is an organisation dedicated to providing educational resources for its community and other. 
We value every single person and the way they best learn. Which brings us to the point that we acknowledge 
that fact that everyone learns different whether thats following video tutorials better, or following 
written tutorials better.

## How can you contribute to this growing guide?
