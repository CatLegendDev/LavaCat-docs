# MenuDocs Official Written Guides.
---

## Why a written guide from MenuDocs?

MenuDocs is an organisation dedicated to providing educational resources for its community and other. 
We value every single person and the way they best learn. Which brings us to the point that we acknowledge 
that fact that everyone learns different whether thats following video tutorials better, or following 
written tutorials better.

## How can you contribute to this growing guide?

A simple PR request is one step closer to displaying your guide on our website. All credits are given where
due which means you're able to display your github redirect at the top of all your guides. We advise that
you join the discord to get better help with implementing your guide which you can find above.

## Can I contribute to improving the theme used on the website?

You sure can! You'll be able to find the theme we use on a repository displayed on our github.

## How to create a guide?

1) Fork the guides repo here: https://github.com/MenuDocs/guides
2) First create your folder in here: https://github.com/MenuDocs/guides/tree/master/guide/topics
3) Then head on over to here to add your sidebar: https://github.com/MenuDocs/guides/blob/master/guide/.vuepress/components/Sidebar.js
4) You'll need a base README.md in the file which will be the "fallback" file. you can reference the other current guides for more information.
4) Any images you would like to have will need to go in a folder displayed here: https://github.com/MenuDocs/guides/tree/master/guide/.vuepress/public/images. You can then access them like "/images/nameOfFolder/image.png"
5) You will only need to have 1 category (the programming language used or the service used. "How to setup a VPS for Node.js" or "Introduction to Frontend Development" are examples of a name.) displayed in the README aswell as any legitimately related tags (frameworks, libraries, development type), this can be seen here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MenuDocs/guides/master/guide/topics/discordjs/README.md
6) Structure your guide, split your guide into Subheadings which ultimately can be subpages.
7) Review your guide to make sure it's factual, straight to the point with all the valid information required and overall has great use of the English language.
8) Add yourself and anyone that helped as an author. Note that the way our guide is designed is the author your provide must be a valid github user.
9) Create a Pull Request to the original repo which will allow it to be review and ultimately merged
10) Kachow, you're on the guide! Thank you for contributing.
